# ![RealWorld Example App](logo.png)

> ### dodrio codebase containing real world examples (CRUD, auth, advanced patterns, etc) that adheres to the [RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld) spec and API.


### [Demo](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld)


This codebase was created to demonstrate a fully fledged fullstack application built with **dodrio** including CRUD operations, authentication, routing, pagination, and more.

We've gone to great lengths to adhere to the **dodrio** community styleguides & best practices.

For more information on how to this works with other frontends/backends, head over to the [RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld) repo.


# How it works

> Describe the general architecture of your app here

# Getting started

```sh
> cargo install -f wasm-pack # only needed once
> wasm-pack build --target no-modules
> cargo install -f basic-http-server # only needed once
> basic-http-server # or any static web server
> # navigate to localhost:4000 e.g. xdg-open http://localhost:4000
```
